/* TESTSUITE.cpp
*    by tHE iNCREDIBLE mACHINE
*
*  Used to test C++ programs. The idea is to define a function, or testcase,
*  that checks whether a given function works. The suite then takes care of
*  providing random input (if desired) and output validation. The suite can
*  also interlink results before quitting.
